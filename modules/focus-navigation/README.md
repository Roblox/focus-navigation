# FocusNavigationService

The EventPropagationService is currently an implementation detail of the FocusNavigationService. It is primarily responsible for functionality related to propagating events registered and triggered by the consumer.

## Types

### EventPhase
```lua
type EventPhase = "Bubble" | "Capture" | "Target"
```
Re-exported from the [EventPropagation module](../event-propagation/src/README.md#eventphase).

### Event
```lua
type Event<T> = {
    cancelled: boolean,
    phase: EventPhase,
    currentInstance: Instance,
    targetInstance: Instance,
    eventName: string,
    eventData: T,
    cancel: () -> ()
}
```
Re-exported from the [EventPropagation module](../event-propagation/src/README.md#event).

### EventHandler
```lua
type EventHandler<T> = (e: Event<T>) -> ()
```
Re-exported from the [EventPropagation module](../event-propagation/src/README.md#eventhandler).

### EventHandlerMap
```lua
type EventHandlerMap<T> = {
	[string]: {
		handler: EventHandler<T>,
		phase: EventPhase?,
	},
}
```
Re-exported from the [EventPropagation module](../event-propagation/src/README.md#eventhandlermap).

### EventMap
```lua
type EventMap = {
	[Enum.KeyCode]: string,
}
```
A mapping of input KeyCodes to event names. When an `EventMap` is registered on a `GuiObject` via `FocusNavigationService:registerEventMap`, the named events will be fired and propagated when the given input is observed.

### EventData
```lua
type EventData = {
    Delta: Vector3,
    KeyCode: Enum.KeyCode,
    Position: Vector3,
    UserInputState: Enum.UserInputState,
    UserInputType: Enum.UserInputType,
    wasProcessed: boolean?,
}
```
`EventData` is a combination of properties from the input [`InputObject`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/InputObject) provided to the input event callback and other information related to the event. `EventData` is accessed through the `eventData` field of the `Event` passed to an EventHandler.

### ContainerFocusBehavior
```lua
type ContainerFocusBehavior = {
    onDescendantFocusChanged: (GuiObject?) -> (),
    getTarget: () -> GuiObject?,
}
```
The `ContainerFocusBehavior` type represents a set of gamepad focus behavior rules that will be applied to a container `GuiObject`. The two functions are callbacks triggered by the FocusNavigationService to help redirect selection when a container gains focus.

This is useful for things like declaring a default descendant to be focused when a page gains focus, or tracking the most recently focused descendant and restoring it when returning from a modal.

#### onDescendantFocusChanged
This function will be called any time focus changes within a given container. It can be used to track focus history within a container so that it can be restored in the future.

If the focus is redirected from its initial target, this callback will only be fired with the _new_ focus target, not the one that was redirected away from.

#### getTargets
Returns an array of `GuiObject` candidates that should gain focus when focus moves from _outside_ of the container to _into_ it. This function's return dictates the initial or restored focus state that the `ContainerFocusBehavior` will redirect to. The `FocusNavigationService` will attempt to validate each member in the provided order, using [`isValidFocusTarget`](#isvalidfocustarget), and redirect focus to the first valid one. If the list is empty or no members are valid, focus will not be redirected.

## Top-Level API

### FocusNavigationService

```lua
type FocusNavigationService = FocusNavigation.FocusNavigationService
```
Exports the FocusNavigationService object, which can be instantiated using the static [`new` function](#new) described below.

### EngineInterface

```lua
type EngineInterface = {
    CoreGui = FocusNavigation.EngineInterfaceType,
    PlayerGui = FocusNavigation.EngineInterfaceType,
}
```
Provides the two possible engine interface modes for the `FocusNavigationService`. These interfaces abstract over engine functionality that the `FocusNavigationService` needs to use under the hood, such as distinguishing between `GuiService.SelectedObject` and `GuiService.SelectedCoreObject`.

### isValidFocusTarget
```lua
FocusNavigation.isValidFocusTarget(target: Instance?) -> (boolean, string?)
```
Returns a boolean representing whether or not the target is capable of receiving focus via Roblox engine selection (i.e. "Can GuiService.Selected(Core)Object be set to this value?").

If the function returns `false`, the second return value will contain an error string explaining why the `target` was not a valid focus target. This can be ignored or escalated as a warning or error message if needed.


## FocusNavigationService API

### new

```lua
FocusNavigationService.new(engineInterface: FocusNavigation.EngineInterfaceType)
```
Create a new `FocusNavigationService`. Intended only to be called once. Provide the relevant [`EngineInterface`](#engineinterface) for the context:
* use `EngineInterface.CoreGui` to manage focus for UI mounted under the `CoreGui` service
* use `EngineInterface.PlayerGui` to manage focus for UI mounted under a Player instance's `PlayerGui` child

### registerEventMap

```lua
FocusNavigationService:registerEventMap(
    guiObject: GuiObject,
    eventMap: EventMap,
)
```
Register a mapping of input KeyCodes to event names for a given `GuiObject`. Event names can be tied to event handlers with `registerEventHandler` or `registerEventHandlers`.

Using semantic event names means that inputs can have generalized meanings that apply contextually via handlers for various parts of the application.

### deregisterEventMap

```lua
FocusNavigationService:deregisterEventMap(
    guiObject: GuiObject,
    eventMap: EventMap,
)
```
Deregister a set of event mappings for the given `GuiObject`.

### registerEventHandler

```lua
FocusNavigationService:registerEventHandler(
    guiObject: GuiObject,
    eventName: string,
    eventHandler: EventHandler<FocusNavigationEventData>,
    phase: EventPhase?
)
```
Register an individual `EventHandler`. This requires a `GuiObject` (the event will only fire when that `GuiObject` is focused), the event handler itself, and the name of the event. The event's name will be meaningful within the context of the application. An `EventPhase` optionally can be passed in to indicate which event propagation phase the handler should be triggered in, this defaults to `"Bubble"`.

### registerEventHandlers

```lua
FocusNavigationService:registerEventHandlers(
    guiObject: GuiObject,
    map: EventHandlerMap<FocusNavigationEventData>
)
```
Register multiple `EventHandler`s from an instance using an `EventHandlerMap`.

### deregisterEventHandler
```lua
FocusNavigationService:deregisterEventHandler(
    guiObject: GuiObject,
    eventName: string,
    eventHandler: EventHandler<FocusNavigationEventData>,
    phase: EventPhase?
)
```
Deregister a single `EventHandler` from an `GuiObject` based on a phase. If phase is not passed in it defaults to `"Bubble"`.

### deregisterEventHandlers
```lua
FocusNavigationService:deregisterEventHandlers(
    guiObject: GuiObject,
    map: EventHandlerMap<FocusNavigationEventData>
)
```
Deregister multiple `EventHandler`s from an instance using an `EventHandlerMap`.

### registerFocusBehavior
```lua
FocusNavigationService:registerFocusBehavior(
    guiObject: GuiObject,
    containerFocusBehavior: ContainerFocusBehavior,
)
```
Register a `ContainerFocusBehavior` on the given `GuiObject` container. Whenever focus moves from _outside_ of that container to _inside_ of that container, the behavior will trigger and redirect focus if a new target is provided.

Additionally, the `onDescendantFocusChanged` callback on the provided behavior will be fired every time focus changes _to_ a descendant, either from outside the container, `nil` (nothing focused at all), or from another descendant inside the container. It will not be fired when focus moves _out_ of the container.

Only one behavior can be registered on a given container object, so registering a new behavior without deregistering the old one will overwrite the old one (and issue a warning in DEV mode). If multiple behaviors should be combined, use the [`composeFocusBehaviors`](#composefocusbehaviors) utility to order them appropriately.

### deregisterEventHandler
```lua
FocusNavigationService:deregisterFocusBehavior(
    guiObject: GuiObject,
    containerFocusBehavior: ContainerFocusBehavior,
)
```
Deregisters a `ContainerFocusBehavior` from a given `GuiObject` container. This means that no additional processing will occur when focus moves into the container, and focus will otherwise behave as dictated by the engine and any relevant `Instance` properties.

### focusGuiObject
```lua
FocusNavigationService:focusGuiObject(
    guiObject: GuiObject,
    silent: boolean
)
```
Move focus to the target GuiObject. Providing a value of `true` for the `silent` argument will suppress event capturing and bubbling, triggering registered events only for the target guiObjects themselves (both the previous focus and the new one).

### Observable Fields
ðŸ›  *Under construction* ðŸ› 
The `FocusNavigationService` also exposes observable properties 

#### activeEventMap
```lua
FocusNavigationService.activeEventMap: Observable<GuiObject?>
```

An observable property that provides the currently active mapping of input KeyCodes to focus navigation events. The active event map is composed from all events associated with the currently-focused `GuiObject` and its ancestors, where elements deeper in the tree will override events bound to their ancestors.

Subscribe to this value with an Observer object as per the [ZenObservable API](https://github.com/zenparsing/zen-observable#observablesubscribeobserver).
```lua
local subscription = FocusNavigation.activeEventMap:subscribe({
    next = function(evenMap)
        for keyCode, event in eventMap do
            print(string.format("trigger %s when pressing %s", event, tostring(keyCode))
        end
    end
})
```

#### focusedInstance
```lua
FocusNavigationService.focusedInstance: Observable<GuiObject?>
```

An observable property that tracks the currently focused instance. This is similar to connecting directly to the  `GuiService:GetPropertyChanged` signal for the relevant property, but provides a nicer interface and automatically connects to the right `GuiService` property.

Subscribe to this value with an Observer object as per the [ZenObservable API](https://github.com/zenparsing/zen-observable#observablesubscribeobserver).
```lua
local subscription = FocusNavigation.focusedInstance:subscribe({
    next = function(newFocus)
        print(if newFocus then newFocus.Name else "(None)")
    end
})
```
